Simple Web Contact Form
Introduction
A form often needs to be used to pass data to various other applications. In many cases, it could be a database, in others, it may be to give a specific answer or a quote. Regardless of how the information may need to be used, it is an important skill to be able to move data to new pages so it can be manipulated for use in further code. For this project, you will create a HTML web form.

Requirements
The form should consist of:

A text input for user’s name
A text input for user’s email address
A drop down to select user’s issue (Query, Feedback, Complaint, Other)
A text area for user’s comment
The form will post to a second page which will display the information in an easy to read format.
There are more optional conditions to add challenge and/or better functionality to your form below
